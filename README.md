# Track Your Tasks 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## [Task Tracker](https://sotonye0808.github.io/task-tracker-app)

This is a simple task tracker app built using React. It allows users to track their tasks by adding, deleting, and marking tasks as complete.

## Features
- Add new tasks: Users can add tasks by entering a task name and optionally specifying a day and time.
- Delete tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- Toggle reminder: Users can toggle a reminder for a task, which will display their tasks boldly so they won't forget.
- Usage statistics: The app tracks the number of tasks added and removed by the user on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.
- Responsive design: The app is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Persistent data: Task data is stored uniquely for each user, so tasks persist even after refreshing the page.
